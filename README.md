# 🎄 Advent of Code – My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** — a yearly
programming challenge held every December.

## ⭐ About Advent of Code

Advent of Code (AoC) is a series of 25 daily programming puzzles released from **December 1 to December 25**.
Each puzzle has **two parts**, increasing in difficulty, and can be solved using any programming language.

Created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), AoC has been running since 2015 and attracts thousands of participants
worldwide.

## 🎯 Goals & Learning Objectives

This repository serves as a platform for continuous learning and skill development:

### Core Goals

- **Algorithm Design**: Solve diverse computational problems across multiple years
- **Clean Code**: Write maintainable, testable, and well-documented solutions
- **Multi-Language Proficiency**: Implement solutions in both C# and C++
- **Modern Practices**: Apply contemporary software engineering patterns

### Technical Learning

- **C# Best Practices**: Modern .NET patterns, dependency injection, async/await
- **C/C++ Fundamentals**: Memory management, build systems, performance optimization
- **CMake**: Cross-platform build configuration and project management
- **Terminal UI Development**: Interactive console applications in both C# and C++
- **Neovim Mastery**: Vim motions, LSP configuration, and workflow optimization

### Long-Term Goals

- 🌐 **Build a website** to display all results across years
